# XcodeTemplates


## How to use CLEAN Architecture template:

1. Put contents of "Base" folder in Xcode project
2. Go to ~/Users/<#username#>/Library/Developer/Xcode/
3. Create "Templates" folder if not existing already and put inside it the ".xctemplate" folder you want
4. In Xcode try to add new file and look for added template

Known Issue: Target membership is missing when template is added. Have to remove folder and add it again
